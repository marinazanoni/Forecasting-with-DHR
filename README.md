# **Statistical Learning Project 2024** ðŸŽ“

Welcome to the **Statistical Learning Project 2024**, a deep dive into machine learning applications for real-world urban challenges. This repository highlights our journey in building predictive models to analyze and optimize waste management systems for the city of **Rome**, as a collaboration with AMA (Azienda Municipale Ambiente).

## **About the Project**

### **Objective**
Our primary goal is to develop a robust statistical learning model to:
1. Understand waste management patterns in Rome using advanced classification and regression techniques.
2. Provide actionable insights to AMA for improving efficiency and sustainability in urban waste collection.

### Project Highlights

- **Objective**: Develop robust predictive models, validate and compare them with rigorous statistical methods
- **Techniques Used**:
  - Random Forests
  - Cross-Validation for Model Optimization
  - Comparison with Statistical Models s.a. DHR ( Dynamic Harmonic Regressions among the classical ARMA and ARIMA)

**Real-World Data**:
   - Analyzed historical datasets on waste collection trends in Rome.
   - Practical applications for improving waste management systems, driving sustainability.
