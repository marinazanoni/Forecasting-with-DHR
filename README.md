## Statistical Learning Project 2024 ðŸš€

This repository contains the work-in-progress and completed milestones of our **Statistical Learning Project 2024**, a collaborative effort to explore and apply advanced machine learning techniques to real-world datasets. 

### Project Highlights

- **Objective**: Develop robust predictive models, validate and compare them with rigorous statistical methods
- **Techniques Used**:
  - Random Forests
  - Cross-Validation for Model Optimization
  - Comparison with Statistical Models s.a. DHR ( Dynamic Harmonic Regressions among the classical ARMA and ARIMA)

- **Datasets**:

### Why This Project Stands Out?

1. **Real-World Relevance**: Tackling complex, high-dimensional datasets that mimic real-world scenarios.
2. **Performance Optimization**: Applying rigorous cross-validation techniques to refine model performance.
3. **Collaborative Innovation**: Blending statistical theory with practical machine learning applications.
4. **Open Source Spirit**: Sharing insights and code for community learning.
