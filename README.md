# **Statistical Learning Project 2024** 🎓

Welcome to the **Statistical Learning Project 2024**, a deep dive into machine learning applications for real-world urban challenges.
This repository some highlights from the Project for Statistical Learning for a real case application for the city of **Rome**, analyzing Roman's complaints.

## **About the Project**

### **Objective**
Our primary goal is to develop a robust statistical learning model to:
1. Understand waste management patterns in Rome using advanced classification and regression techniques.
2. Provide actionable insights to AMA for improving efficiency and sustainability in urban waste collection.

### Project Highlights

- **Objective**: Develop robust predictive models, validate and compare them with rigorous statistical methods
- **Techniques Used**:
  - Random Forests
  - Cross-Validation for Model Optimization
  - Comparison with Statistical Models s.a. DHR ( Dynamic Harmonic Regressions among the classical ARMA and ARIMA)

**Real-World Data**:
   - Real and messy data 😟. A significant amount of effort was dedicated to preprocessing the data to extract meaningful insights. Additional datasets were extrapolated for descriptive and narrative analysis. 
   - Analyzed historical datasets on complaints trends in Rome.
   - Practical applications for improving waste management systems, driving sustainability.
